# Winkel_Trivedi_et_al_2022_Seasonal_ice_snow_communities

This is the repository for the manuscript "Seasonal  evolution of glacial snow and ice microbial communities" written by Matthias Winkel, Christopher B. Trivedi, Rey Mourot, James A. Bradley, Andrea Vieth-Hillebrand, and Liane G Benning.The raw data can be obtained from the Sequence Read Archive at NCBI under accession numbers SRR12490806-SRR12490826 (16S and 18s) and SRR12589324-SRR12589336 (ITS2), all of which are associated with BioProject PRJNA657180.

Contained here are R files used to process raw Illumina paired-end amplicon data for the above publication. We offer these scripts in order to be as transparent as possible with our sequencing data processing.

The workflow follows that of [processing marker gene sequences](http://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html) via DADA2 in R as provided by Ben Callahan.
