# Winkel_Trivedi_et_al_2022_Seasonal_ice_snow_communities
A set of R documents used to process raw Illumina paired-end amplicon data for the above publication. We offer these scripts in order to be as transparent as possible when it comes to sequencing data processing.

These scripts can be used as such or by executing commands individually. Personally, I like to go through each separately.

Please keep in mind this is more for our own consistency of data processing over different sample types and for transparency of workflow.
